-- The idea here is that you can just mark in-use array slots (stored in the negative keys)
-- with an ID, which is updated after every "frame". As opposed to using booleans, you don't
-- need to wipe the whole array, only update the ID. (Although probably not a concern with
-- doubles, you can even ensure you don't have false positives by gradually overwriting
-- one or more entries after each frame.)
